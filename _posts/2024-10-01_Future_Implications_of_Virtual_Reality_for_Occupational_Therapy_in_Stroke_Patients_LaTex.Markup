Written in LaTex, this essay details how the integration of virtual reality (VR) into occupational therapy offers significant potential for enhancing stroke rehabilitation. By creating immersive, controlled environments, VR can provide stroke patients with engaging and repetitive therapeutic activities tailored to their specific needs. This technology allows therapists to simulate real-world tasks in a safe, customizable manner, facilitating motor skill recovery and cognitive function. Furthermore, VR can track patient progress in real-time, enabling data-driven adjustments to therapy plans. As VR technology continues to evolve, its accessibility and effectiveness could revolutionize stroke rehabilitation, providing new opportunities for personalized and adaptive therapies.
