I am currently enrolled in my fourth (4th) year at the University of Calgary, completing two undergraduate degrees in Kinesiology and Finance.
<br>
<br>
Qualifications:
<br>
I am proficient in many Microsoft Office platforms, specifically Excel, Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint. My work experience has taught me the importance of customer service, strong communication skills, and provided me the ability to work with a variety of different perspectives. I am often complimented on my attention to detail. This attention to detail results in high quality of work. All of my previous work experience involved direct face-to-face customer interaction, allowing me to respond appropriately to different types of situations.
<br>
<br>
As detailed in my resume, over the past three years, I have experienced working in an office setting with various companies, mainly in non-profit organizations. This experience has allowed me to understand the inner workings of an office environment and how to appropriately respond to the ever-changing expectations of a role depending on business needs. Through extensive use of various software programs in my past employment, I have gained transferable skills and the ability to become proficient when exposed to new technologies.
Furthermore, I have experience with a variety of coding programs and languages including Python, R-studio and both HTML and Markdown languages.

Volunteering:

Currently, I am a part of an interdisciplinary club at the University of Calgary called UCalgary Racing. This is my second year on the team and the primary focus is to create an open-wheeled electric race car. As a part of the business team, my role is to initiate communication with potential sponsors, manage various social media platforms, organize different events throughout the school year and serve as a liaison between various engineering sub-teams.

This website was created using the Chirpy theme for Jekyll and I used Github to construct this website. There are two main posts for this project, one is an excel spreadsheet and the other is a video analysis.
